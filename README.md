# finite_field

This is a repository for implementing finite fields in `C/C++`.

This is just a initialization of the repo, it may be a while before any actual
work gets pushed.

This repository is aimed to replace the finite field library developed by
ArashPartow; which can be found at [ArashPartow/galois](https://github.com/ArashPartow/galois).
